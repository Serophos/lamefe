<h1><a name="1">1. Introduction</a></h1>

<h2><a name="1.1">1.1 What Is lameFE</a></h2>

<p>lameFE is basically a <b>f</b>ront-<b>e</b>nd for <b>lame</b>. It provides a simple user interface for the lame encoder and extends the abilities of lame for support for more multimedia formats.
lameFE is able to convert Wave Audio and CD Digital Audio to MP3 and will become extendable with plug-ins to offer a wider support for multimedia files.</p>

<p>Here is a short list of the lameFE features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rip Audio CDs to Wave Audio or MP3 (MPEG I / II Layer 3)</li>

<li>Convert Wave Audio to MP3 (MPEG I / II Layer 3)</li>

<li>Query freeDB server to access file / and album information of CDs</li>

<li>Write id3 version 2 frames</li>

<li>Id3 tag editor</li>

<li>User defined filename format</li>

<li>Playback of Audio CDs</li>

<li>Play converted files / create play lists</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="1.2">1.2 System Requirements</a></h2>

<p>Minimum System requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 98/ME or Windows NT 4.51 / 2000 / XP</li>

<li>Pentium processor or compatible*</li>

<li>(Adaptec) ASPI driver to access CD drives</li>

<li>Internet connection to access freeDB server</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The MP3 compression consumes a lot of computation time, actually, the lame encoder that's used by lameFE is relatively fast compared to other MP3 encoders (with comparable sound quality, listen
the output of the Xing 'fast' encoder, and you know what I mean). With a Pentium 166-MMX, with 32 Mb of SD-RAM, a one minute song, takes about 2 minutes to rip and encode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="1.3">1.3 Installation</a></h2>

<p>There are no special installation requirements. To install lameFE, start the installer and follow the instructions. Before installing remove any previous version of lameFE from your system.</p>

<p>On some system you will need to install a ASPI driver. lameFE needs it to access the CD-ROM drivers. On Windows XP lameFE should work with the native ASPI driver of Windows XP. Before installing
an ASPI driver check whether there is a file winaspi.sys in your %windir%\system32 directory (whereas %windir% stands for your windows directory). Upgrading ASPI drivers may prevent CD-Burning
programs to work properly.</p>

<p>You can download an ASPI driver at <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/support/supportdetail.html?prodkey=ASPI-4.70">
http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/support/supportdetail.html?prodkey=ASPI-4.70</a></p>

<br>
 

<h1><a name="2">2 Using lameFE</a></h1>

<h2><a name="2.1">2.1 Encoder Settings</a></h2>

<p>The Main part of lameFE is the lame Encoder. It &ldquo;converts&rdquo; the CD-Digital Audio / Wave files into Mp3 files. You can make several changes on the quality and speed the lame encoder
converts the files. In the Main Programs dialog choose Encoder Settings from the Preferences menu or click on the Encoder settings button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" width="548" height="104" src="Manual-Dateien/image002.jpg"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most users the default settings for the encoder should work fine but some people prefer higher bitrates. Higher bitrates will increase both quality and size of the file.</p>

<p>You may also select the number of channels the MP3 File will have: Stereo / Mono / Joint Stereo (lower quality, smaller size), and Dual channel are offered by the lame encoder.</p>

<p>Copyright / Private / Original will mark the file as copyrighted protected / private use only or original record.</p>

<p>Checksum will write a crc checksum to the file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="2.2">2.2 Ripping Audio CDs</a></h2>

<p><img border="0" width="605" height="391" src="Manual-Dateien/image004.jpg"><br>
The lameFE main programs dialog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can rip CD Digital Audio Tracks to Wave or MP3 files. By default lameFE is in the CD to MP3 mode. To select the output format either click to &ldquo;CD -&gt; MP3&rdquo; or<br>
&ldquo;CD -&gt; WAV&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To rip an Audio CD, insert it to your CD drive select the tracks you want to extract from the CD and click on &ldquo;Start encoding&rdquo; to start the ripping process. Before that you may want to
query a freeDB server to gain the album / tack information for CD. See section 2.4.1 of this document for details.</p>

<h3><a name="2.2.1">2.2.1 Select CD drive</a></h3>

<p>On systems with two or more CD / DVD drives you have to select the CD Drive lameFE reads from. By default the first CD drive is selected (LUN:0). To change the CD-Drive you want to use select
&ldquo;CD-Reader settings&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; Menu in the programs main dialog and select the CD-Drive from the drop down list &ldquo;CD ROM&rdquo; and click on OK.</p>

<p><img border="0" width="572" height="198" src="Manual-Dateien/image005.jpg"></p>

<h3><a name="2.2.2">2.2.2 CD Drive / Reader settings</a></h3>

<p>To change the settings for a CD drive select &ldquo;CD-Reader settings&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; Menu in the programs main dialog. You will see the dialog above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CD ROM Type&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ripping Method&rdquo; should only be changed by expert users or when there are problems with the &ldquo;Generic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; selection
(when you rip an Audio CD and there is only silence adjust these settings to the one that match your drive).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lock CD Drive during extraction&rdquo; will lock when lameFE accesses it. It can&rsquo;t be opened in that time. This is saver and will prevent errors when the drive is opened during
extraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eject CD when done&rdquo; &ndash; Well I think there is no explanation needed</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swap channels&rdquo; &ndash; Well I think there is no explanation needed</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use native NT SCSI Library&rdquo; will force lameFE to use the SCSI Library of NT instead of the Adaptec ASPI driver or any other installed ASPI driver. Use this setting only if an ASPI
driver doesn&rsquo;t work for you. You will need to restart lameFE to take this setting into effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CD Speed&rdquo; is the maximum speed your CD Drive is capable for digital reading of audio CDs. Note this is not the maximum CD drive speed. Look in your users manual of the CD ROM drive
for the correct value. 32 is default value and will work for most CD drives, even when they can read digital audio only at lower speeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spin up time&ldquo; specifies the time, your CD drive needs to spin up to the maximum speed.</p>

<h2><a name="2.3">2.3 Converting multimedia files to MP3</a></h2>

<p>Click on WAV to MP3 to switch to convert Wave Audio files to MP3. Add the files you want to convert and click on &ldquo;Start Encoding&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><a name="2.3.1">2.3.1 Add files to list</a></h3>

<p>To add files to the list choose &ldquo;Add file&rdquo; from the &rdquo;File&rdquo; menu (or press STRG+O).</p>

<h3><a name="2.3.2">2.3.2 Remove files from list</a></h3>

<p>To remove a file from the list, select it (multiple selections are allowed) and choose &ldquo;Remove file&rdquo; from the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu (or press STRG+R).</p>

<h2><a name="2.4">2.4 Id3 Tags</a></h2>

<p>lameFE offers support for id3v2.x tags to store album and song specific data in the mp3 file.</p>

<p>There are two ways of manipulating these tags (one works only for CDs):</p>

<h3><a name="2.4.1">2.4.1 Query freeDB Servers</a></h3>

<p>FreeDB is a service that offers CD Album information on servers in the internet. For nearly every Audio CD the album name, artist and songs on this CD are available from this service (For further
information visit <a href="http://www.freedb.org/">http://www.freedb.org</a>)</p>

<p>To query the album information for your CD, just click on the freeDB button or choose &ldquo;Read remote CDdb&rdquo; from the &ldquo;CDDB&mp;mp;id3Tag&rdquo; menu. Sometimes there are double ore
more entries for one CD in the server. In this case chose the entry that you like best and click on &rdquo;Continue&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img border="0" width="396" height="302" src="Manual-Dateien/image006.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The information gathered from freeDB will be automatically written to the id3 tags of each file. You can edit these manually by clicking &ldquo;Edit id3 Tags&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><a name="2.4.2">2.4.2 Manual Editing of Id3 Ttags</a></h3>

<p>If you are encoding Wave files or you want to manually edit id3 tags received from freeDB servers, you may do so by using the id3 tag editor of lameFE. Choose &ldquo;Edit id3-Tags&rdquo; from the
&ldquo;CDDB&mp;mp;id3-Tag&rdquo; menu or click on &ldquo;Edit id3 Tags&rdquo; button.</p>

<p><img border="0" width="605" height="377" src="Manual-Dateien/image007.jpg"></p>

<p>For each file / track you can adjust the id3 tag information. When finished click on done. To write only the tags you need to the file uncheck the Checkbox of the value. If you want lameFE to use
a value for all files activate the &ldquo;all files&rdquo; check box for that value.</p>

<p>lameFE allows you to store each file in an user defined file format (i.e. like the &ldquo;Napster&rdquo; style as artist &ndash; song.mp3 (See section 2.5.2 of this document for details). To
deactivate this behavior for on file uncheck Use format string for this file. The filename will be same as the original filename but with the correct ending (mp3).</p>

<h2><a name="2.5">2.5 Customizing lameFE</a></h2>

<p>lameFE is highly customizable. Most default behavior can be changed.</p>

<h3><a name="2.5.1">2.5.1 Basic lameFE settings</a></h3>

<p>To adjust the program settings to your needs select &ldquo;lameFE settings&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; menu or hit F5.</p>

<p>Set Base Output path: To tell lameFE where to store the converted / ripped files click on &ldquo;Output path&rdquo; and select the directory you want lameFE to store the files in. The default is
C:\Program Files\lameFE\Output (assuming you have installed lameFE to C:\Program Files\lameFE).</p>

<p><img border="0" width="604" height="337" src="Manual-Dateien/image008.jpg"></p>

<p>With &ldquo;External Player&rdquo; you can select the Audio Player you want lameFE to use to playback files when finished.</p>

<p>If you want lameFE to overwrite existing files during the conversion, check &ldquo;Always overwrite existing files&rdquo;. The default behavior is to asked for each file.</p>

<p>All other settings in this dialog need no explanation.</p>

<h3><a name="2.5.2">2.5.2 User defined filename format</a></h3>

<p><img border="0" width="548" height="93" src="Manual-Dateien/image009.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To store files i.e. Napster style ore store each file in the directory structure as &ldquo;Artist\Album&rdquo;, select &ldquo;tagWriter Settings&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; menu,
check &ldquo;Rename files to format:&rdquo; and define the format string.</p>

<p>%a\%m\%a -%t for example will store each file in the directory Artist\Album in the format Artist &ndash; Song.mp3 in your base output path. Non existing directories will be created. You may also
add any other characters (that are allowed for filenames) to the format string. A complex example is %a\%m\%a - %t Track %n</p>

<p>%t = Song title</p>

<p>%a = Artist</p>

<p>%m = Album / CD title</p>

<p>%n = Track number on the CD</p>

<p>%y = year</p>

<p>The default is %a\%m\%a -%t.mp3</p>

<br>
 

<h1><a name="3">3. Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> With the mp3's I rip and then view file info in Winamp it says Header found at: xxx bytes and not zero, why?<br>
<b>A</b>: Winamp reports the location of the first MPEG header in the MPEG stream data. If you have enabled the ID3V2 tags, it will place the ID3V2 header before the MPEG stream, the first MPEG
header will be shifted with the size of the ID3V2 header.</p>

<a name="napster"><p><b>Q:</b> When I extract MP3 files from a CD, I would like lameFE to create 'Napster Style' file names ([artist]-[title].mp3) instead storing tracks as track_1.mp3, how can I do that?<br>
<b>A</b>: Select Preferences/tagWriter Settings and activate "Rename to format" and specify a format string.</p>
</a>

<a name="cddberr"><p><b>Q:</b> At home, I can access the CDDB database, but when I use lameFE at my work place it does not work.<br></a>
<b>A</b>: At your work you are almost certainly behind a firewall, therefore you have to select the Use Proxy option in the CDDB options dialog box (Preferences/CDDB Setup). In addition you have to
fill in the proxy address in the edit field next to the Use Proxy selection box (which should be enabled when you've selected the Use Proxy option, and maybe have to change the Proxy Port). A tip:
take a look at the proxy settings of your Web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Netscape) to determine the proxy address and proxy port.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> When I try to access the CDDB database, I get an Invalid E-mail Address message<br>
<b>A</b>: You have to fill in the E-mail Address field in the CDDB options dialog box (Preferences/CDDB Setup).</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> When I try to start lameFE, it complains that it can&rsquo;t find the CDRip.dll, tagWriter.dll file(s) or Lame_enc.dll.<br>
<b>A</b>: Make sure that you unzip all the files (using for example WinZip) in the lameFE installation directory Furthermore, make sure if you have created a desktop short-cut that the START-IN field
points to the directory where the lameFE.exe and its DLLs reside (this is the folder in which you have extracted the files that were in the ZIP)</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Will lameFE work with Windows 2000<br>
<b>A</b>: Many people have problems running lameFE with the Windows 2000 operation system. However, you have to make sure that you have installed the proper ASPI drivers that are supported under
Win2K. You might try to install the aspi package offered in the download section. Some people have successfully used it in conjunction with lameFE.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> Where can I obtain the proper ASPI drivers<br>
<b>A</b>: If you have Software or Hardware from Adaptec, you can obtain the drivers from the Adaptec site. If you have not any of that, you can use a utility (both for Windows NT and Window 98) named
ASPI_ME, although it is officially banned by Adaptec, it is still available from some WEB sites (take a look at this site, and search for aspi_me). However, there is a time lock in this utility, so
you need to set back your system clock to somewhere in 1998 when starting ASPI_ME. Afterwards, you can set back your system clock to the current data. Furthermore, you can look at one of the
following resources:</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> When I extract file there is no music at all, just dead silence, what's wrong?<br>
<b>A</b>: This problem might be a couple of things:<br>
1.Make sure that you have installed the proper ASPI drivers. This link http://w3.westnet.gr/mp3/rippers/aspi.htm has information how to install the proper ASPI drivers (version Adaptec's ASPI version
4.54 or 4.57 should work)<br>
2) Make sure your drive does support CDDA (see http://www.mp3.com/cdrom.html to determine if your drive does support CDDA<br>
3) Go to Preferences/CD-Reader Settings and try out some other settings for CD-ROM type and Ripping method. See your CD-ROM drive handbook for more information. "Generic" and "Standard" should work
with every CD drive. I'll include an auto detection method in one of the next versions.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> When I convert/rip MP3 file, it takes a very long time, is there something wrong?<br>
<b>A</b>: The MP3 compression consumes a lot of computation time, actually, the lame encoder that's used by lameFE is relatively fast compared to other MP3 encoders (with comparable sound quality,
listen the output of the Xing 'fast' encoder and you know what I mean). The ripping process can be slow when you have Pentium 166-MMX, with 32 Mb of SD-RAM, a one minute song, takes about 2 minutes
to rip and encode.<br>
With certain CD-ROM drives you might get better performance when you set the CD-SPEED to 32, but this might increase the change of jitter errors.</p>
